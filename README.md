## UX

### User Stories

+ As a user, I would like to be able to â€¦

1.  easily navigate throughout the website and questions.
2.  see in which question I am answering and how many more I have;
3.  add my name and save my score;
4.  see how I rank on the High Scores.
5.  quickly check the High Scores when coming back to the game later on.

### 1. Strategy 

 * Project Purpose

    Create an interactive quiz with consistent styling across all pages ensuring that the application runs flawlessly across all devices. 

Project Goals

   + Provide a fun and interactive application;
   + Test general people knowledge about landmarks and places around the world;
   + Allow user to log scores and compare with previews attempts.


### 2. Scope

 * I wanted a simple, straightforward intuitive UX experience;
 * I wanted my content to be clear; 
 * A site that is visually appealing on most devices.


### 3. Structure

* A clear and simple layout is in place to ensure users can navigate intuitively and have an easy experience.
* Navbar is fixed on top to facilitate users to navigate through pages easily. Small navigation is the same on all pages to ensure easy navigation.
* Index page displays game and character introduction and instructions to the game. 
* Game page effectively shows one question, four answer options, countdown timer, and progress bar and text to show what question you are on.
* End game page can be found to add your name on your score. 
* High Scores page shows ranking scores.

### 4. Skeleton

Wireframes created with Balsamiq. The project was developed from initial wireframes and some modifications were made during the development process to assure better usability. 

Click to see wireframes:

[Game Page](assets/images/readme_screenshots/wireframegame_page.png) <br>
[High Score Page](assets/images/readme_screenshots/wireframegame_page.png)

The end page was added later on project, on this way there's no wireframe of it.

### 5. Surface

* Colours

The Colour scheme was generated using eye dropper plugin, to get one colour from the logo image, and [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/) to generate the colour pallete.

<p align="center" width="100%">
  <img width="33%" src="assets/images/readme_screenshots/color_pallete.png">
</p>


<p><img width="30px" src="assets/images/readme_screenshots/black_color.png">
Black color  was chosen to all game text and buttons, and also on footer text, to assure better readbility.</p>


<p>
  <img width="30px" src="assets/images/readme_screenshots/white_color.png">
White color was used on some buttons and navbar and footer background. </p>

* Font Selection
 
Two complimentary fonts were chosen with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to be used across the whole of the website.

The chosen fonts were Lato for headings, and navbar and Montserrat for lists, button and paragraphs.

## Existing Features

+ There is also a go home button that leads the user to the index page after check the high score list.
   
## Future Features 

I would like to add:

+ more questions to question bank and storage it on an API;
+ choose a difficult option;

+ external storage for ranking;
+ option to know more about the question even if the user answers it correctly.

### Manual Testing

   + Desktop

 Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge: everything is working good. Page loads and all of the page features are working.

   + Mobile
 
 Tested with Xiaomi Mi6, Xiaomi Mi8, Samsung J8, Samsumg A30 and Iphone X and webpage works well. It is responsive as intended and with no page deformations.

   + Mozilla Dev Tools
 
 Tested for available devices, webpage works well. It is responsive as intended, with no page deformations.
 
 ## Accessibility tests
 
 The entire website was verified about accessibility using [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/). 

The error and alerts for each page can be viewed on the links:

[Index page](assets/images/readme_screenshots/accessibilitytest_index.png) &nbsp;
[Game Page](assets/images/readme_screenshots/accessibilitytest_gamepage.png) &nbsp; 
[End Page](assets/images/readme_screenshots/accessibilitytest_endpage.png) &nbsp; 
[High scores Page](assets/images/readme_screenshots/accessibilitytest_highscorepage.png)

   + Error

   - Empty button - A bootstrap navbar was used on this game, and, in smaller devices the navbar button have no text on it, just an icon to cick and revels navbar container. 

 + Alerts

    - The redundant link alert showed in all the pages was a design choice, to allow the user easy access (reload the page).
    - The small texts alerts showed on all pages were used by design choice to footer and source credits for the texts.

 
 ## Project Bugs and Solutions:

+ Timer 

There was an issue with the countdown timer  - When the user clicks an answer (correct or not) timer did not stop and if the user didn't click the next button, the error container opened showing an explanation about the question that should open only if a wrong answer clicked. 
I solve this bug by adding a clear interval on SelectedAnswer function. 

```
 
function selectedAnswer(a) {
    const selectedButton = a.target;
    const correct = selectedButton.dataset.correct;
    clearInterval(timer);
        if (correct) {
        this.classList.add('correct');
        scorePoints++;
        // add class if incorrect
    } else {
        this.classList.add('wrong');
        wrongAnswer();
    }
      Array.from(choiceButtons.children).forEach(button => {
        button.disabled = true;
    });
}

```

+ 11th question load 

When the user clicks the nextButton on the last question (10th), it is correctly redirected to the end.html page, but a new question is also rendering. 
This bug will be solved in the next version of the game. 

+ ClearStorage button 

On the initial code is possible to find a clear storage button on the High Scores page. Were tried several functions and it was still not working properly. Then, this button was removed from HTML and this bug will be solved and the clear button will be added in future releases.

+ Game container in smaller screens

During tests were noticed that on smaller screens (like iPhone 5) game page wasn't user friendly because the user needed to scroll down to click the next button or check google maps. This bug was solved adding special @media screen and (max-width: 365px).
 
```

@media screen and (max-width: 320px) {

    h1 {
        padding-top: 0 !important;
    }

    .navbar .navbar-brand {
        font-size: 0.6em;
    }

    .container {
        width: 95%;
    }

    #hint-image {
        width: 55%;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }

    #timer {
        font-size: small;
        margin: 3px auto;
    }

    #question {
        font-size: 1em;
        height: 45px;
    }

    .button {
        font-size: 1em;
    }

    #choice-container {
        left: 5%;
        position: unset;
    }

    #progress-text {
        font-size: x-small;
    }
}

```
